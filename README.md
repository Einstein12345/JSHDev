<h1>JSH Testing README </h1>
<p>JSH was first designed as a way for me to say f**k you to some of the bad practices I noticed in many modern shells and OS designs, such as horrible error reporting, and the annoying habit of not being programmed in a threaded manner as to allow for easy execution in parallel.  In recent days, it has turned into a project of parallelism across platforms through the use of abstract serialization, which will be documented further down in the README. The main driving components of JSH are; ModuleManagement, LogManager, ConnectionManager, JSHProcesses, EventManager, Terminal.  All of these classes will be outlined later in this README.  Note that JSH was built to be a modular system, designed to operate as either a low level system of a high level system, low level being console based, and high level being GUI based.  It can be run on all platforms that support Java, and either as superuser or as a standard user.  It needs no extra libraries, and is higly configurable.</p><p>PS: I apologize for some of the bad documentation and sloppy coding practices used in several of these classes, I began developing this in the 8th grade when I knew very little.</p>
<h2>Abstract Serialization</h2>
<p>The concept of abstract serialization is simple.  All objects that should be "run" within JSH must extend the JProcess class, which in itself is a serializable class.  This is done to ensure that all processes can be broken down into a simple stream of bytes, and transported to other JSH systems to be run later.  The main use of this is in ConnectionManager.</p>
